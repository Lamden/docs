# Revoke Access to your Lamden Vault

![](/img/wallet/gif/1.0.0_account_linked_revoke.gif)

Revoking access removes the permission granted to the DAPP during the <u>[Linked Account Creation](/accounts_linked_create)</u> process.  

Revoking access **DOES NOT** delete the Linked Account from your wallet. It only removes the ability of the DAPP to send transactions.


## Reestablishing a Linked Account
If you wish to re-establish a connection with the linked account you can revisit the DAPPS website. The DAPP will treat you as a new user and you will need to follow the <u>[Linked Account Creation](/accounts_linked_create)</u> process again. The only difference is that this time no **NEW** Linked Account is created. Instead, the DAPP is linked back to the existing Linked Account.
