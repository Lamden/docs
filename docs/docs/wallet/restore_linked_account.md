# Re-Link a Restored Account

![](/img/wallet/gif/1.0.0_dapp_change_association.gif)

Restored Accounts via <u>[Keystore](/accounts_linked_overview)</u> or <u>[Secret Key](/accounts_creation#existing-account)</u> will not have retained their <u>[Linked Account](/accounts_linked_overview)</u>  information and will need to be manually re-linked to the DAPP that created them.

1. Visit the website of the DAPP you wish to link to and initate a connection to the Lamden Vault
2. Follow the <u>[Create Linked Account](/accounts_linked_create)</u> process to create a new Linked Account in the Lamden Vault.

The DAPP is now re-linked to the account you restored.  All of your smart contract associations you had before, to tokens, or NFTs you will now have control over.
