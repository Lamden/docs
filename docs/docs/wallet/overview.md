# Lamden Vault DAPP API Overview

 ![](/img/wallet/wallet_main_view.png)

The Lamden Vault is now using a unique 24-word phrase that is generated when you first set up to manage your acoounts.
We called the 24-word phrase "Secret Recovery Phrase".Your funds are connected to that phrase. If you ever lose your password, your Secret Recovery Phrase allows you to recover your wallet and your funds. Write it down on paper and hide it somewhere, put it in a safety deposit box, or use a secure password manager.
The Lamden Vault also has a number of features that allow the user to interface directly with the Lamden Blockchain.


 - Safe storage of <u>[Account](/accounts_overview)</u> keys (<u>[keypairs](/accounts_linked_overview)</u>).
