| Property  | Example Value | Description  |
| ------------- |------------| -----|
| logo | 'images/logo.png' | This logo will be displayed next to your linked account in the main Lamden Vault view as well as displayed in your linked account detail section of the Lamden Vault |
| background | 'images/background.png' | This is a custom background you can set to replace the default on your linked account detail section of the Lamden Vault  |

**All image paths are relative to your dApp's hostname.**

```javascript

deatil.background = 'images/background.png'
```

## State Charms
Charms can be added to your Linked Account details section of the Lamden Vault and provide state information about your dApps's contract.  An example would a custom token value, the current player's turn in a game, etc.  There is no limit on the amount of charms you can add.  Define the charms and send them along with your initial connection request.  

Each charm can have an indivudial icon. **All image paths are relative to your dApp's hostname.**

Key Variables

```

```javascript
detail.charms = [
    //This creates a charm that always shows the wallets balance of Stu Bucks
    {
        //The label displayed on the charm
        name: "Stu Bucks"
        //The state variable in your dApp's contract
        variableName: "customToken",
        //described in section above this
        key: "<wallet vk>",
        //What format to display the returned value (number will also display as float)
        formatAs: "number",
        //Icon path is relative to your dDapp's hostname
        //This iconPath will become http://www.mydapp.com/images/token.png
        iconPath: "images/token.png",
    },
