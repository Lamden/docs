# Get User Account Info

Your DAPP can get the user's <u>[Linked Account](/wallet/accounts_linked_overview)</u> information by listening for the lamdenWalletInfo event.

This event is triggered when:
1. You send a "lamdenWalletConnect" event
2. You request information from the Lamden Vault by sending a "lamdenWalletGetInfo" event
3. The user locks or unlocks the wallet 

## Listen for Wallet Info
This example assumes your DAPP has previously been approved
```javascript
document.addEventListener('lamdenWalletInfo', (response) => {
    if (response.error.length > 0){
        //Respond to Errors
        return
    }
    if (response.locked){
        //Prompt user to unlock wallet
    }else{
        //Get user's account address
        console.log(response.wallets[0])
    } 
});
// Get Wallet Info
document.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('lamdenWalletGetInfo'));

```

## Request Wallet Info
```javascript
// Get Wallet Info
document.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('lamdenWalletGetInfo'));

```
