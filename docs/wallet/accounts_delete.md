**Before deleting an account it is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED that you perform a <u>[backup](/docs/wallet/backup_overview)</u>.**

Make sure you read and understand the following, before deleting an account:
1. Each wallet account is a seperate association to a cryptographic <u>[keypair](/docs/wallet/accounts_linked_overview)</u>. These keys tell the blockchain who you are and allow you to own things on it.  **After deletion you will no longer be able to access anything you were once associated with or owned.**
2. Unless you have a backup of this account there is no way to recreate or restore the account.  Even if you think you will never use this account again, it is still recommended that you create a <u>[backup](/docs/wallet/backup_overview)</u> and store it safely before deleting it.
